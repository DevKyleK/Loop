# LoopStack
Loop is a system built on the M5Stack for people to use as a "mini" operating system it includes games and apps submitted by the community and is constantly being updated

We aim to provide a secure a robust platform that beginners can use to share their projects with the entire world. When we get to 100 projects we will introduce an installer which will include a whole page list of the apps so that users of LoopStack (Loop) do not have to deal with menus filled with thousands of projects. 

When we recieve an app developer who would like to publish their app we will review their entire code checking that the functionality and typing is correct then we will implement it into the next update which takes up to a month until we introduce an auto update feature.

# How to add your apps...

Head on over to issues and fill in the Add New App form and we will review it and reply if we will or will not implement it into Loop and the reasons why.

Please read our applications terms of services in the github repo
